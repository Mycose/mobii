Mobii Client
=====

Welcome to Mobii! We hope you will enjoy contributing to this project.


1.	Requirements

Mobii is based on the Qt Framework, in order to ensure a complete cross-platform compatibility among various operating systems, notably Microsoft Windows, MacOS X and Linux.

You will need the following tools in order to start coding:

-	Microsoft Visual Studio 2010+ (you may switch to Qt creator using the Qt plugin for MSVC2010)
-	Qt 5 Framework (5.0.1+)
-	Ruby 1.9.x+ in order to run the mobile app emulator

Please see the server branch documentation for further informations about how to use the Mobii server application.

2.	Compiling the client

Before proceeding, please make sure you have a fully functional development environment (see above).

	a.	Libraries

If you compile the client within Visual Studio, Qt libraries should be linked automatically if your Qt setup is configured properly.

When deploying 
	
3.	RTFM!

We are going to deploy a detailed documentation within a few weeks. We are strongly advising you to read it once it becomes available.

Besides the client application itself, it will explain you the philosophy and the technical architecture which drives the entire platform.
